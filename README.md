# Apple Music Library Analyser
The Apple Music application doesn't show a useful breakdown of your library contents.  They're more interested in pestering you to subscribe and own nuthin'.<br>

My iTunes library contains over 30,000 files and is over 1TB in size.  It was first created around 2002 on my iMac G4 with iTunes and has moved from Mac to Mac over the decades.<br>

Most of my songs have been ripped from CDs I've bought over the decades ... the first CD I got was, I think, "5 1/2" by Japanese band KOME KOME CLUB.<br>

I buy more music online now, either Bandcamp or another place, usually in lossless or hi-res formats.<br>

Anyway, here is a Python script that will analyse the files in your library and output a summary.  It can take a while to run as it checks every file.<br>

Here is sample output from a small library on my Macbook Air:
